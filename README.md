# GitHub Actions for CI/CD Pipelines and Security

GitHub Actions is a powerful platform that allows you to automate your software development workflows directly from your GitHub repository. In modern software development, CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipelines are essential for ensuring code quality, automating testing, and streamlining the deployment process. Additionally, security is a critical aspect of any software project, and integrating security checks into your CI/CD pipeline helps to identify vulnerabilities early in the development cycle.
